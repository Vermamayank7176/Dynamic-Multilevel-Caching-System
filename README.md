# Dynamic Multilevel Caching System

## Overview
This project implements a dynamic multilevel caching system in C++ that supports multiple cache levels, eviction policies, and data retrieval across these levels.

## Features
- **Multiple Cache Levels**: Supports dynamic addition and removal of cache levels.
- **Eviction Policies**: Implemented Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU) policies.
- **Data Management**: Handles data retrieval and insertion with eviction and promotion logic.
- **Concurrency**: Optional thread-safety (to be implemented).

## Build Instructions
1. Ensure you have CMake installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
